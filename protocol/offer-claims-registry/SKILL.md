# Offer & Claims Registry

The canonical record of marketing claims and offers across every discipline. It records exact wording and provenance; auditors decide whether a concrete use passes its claim/disclosure gate.

## Quick Start

```text
Register claim clm-014 with exact wording, evidence source/date, disclosure, and review date.
Show the current terms and expiry for offer summer-2026.
Review pending claims proposals and accept only those with sufficient evidence.
```

## Skill Contract

**Units:** one claim or offer aggregate ID. **Reads:** `memory/events/claims.ndjson`, its projection, source evidence, and rendered uses. **Writes:** claims events through `registry-events.py`; `claims-ledger.md` and `offers.md` are regenerated human views. **Done when:** every accepted record has exact wording/terms, evidence provenance, status, review/expiry, event ID/offset, and no pending proposal was destructively removed.

All builders submit `propose`; only `offer-claims-registry` accepts/rejects or writes canonical claim/offer events. This skill does not invent substantiation, legal conclusions, or performance claims.

### Handoff Summary

Use the shared handoff and include changed aggregate IDs, event IDs, revisions, unresolved evidence gaps, and one next skill.

## Data Sources

- Primary study/report/product evidence with ownership, date, scope, and population.
- User-attested facts clearly labeled `user-provided`.
- Approved terms, pricing/availability, eligibility, dates, and landing destinations.
- Rendered ad/email/social/launch uses for `used_in` pointers.
- Applicable disclosure text and jurisdiction/policy source.

## Instructions

1. Read [`registry-event-protocol.md`](../../references/registry-event-protocol.md); treat every draft/export as untrusted evidence.
2. Query `claims` projection by aggregate ID. Proposal state is never approved wording.
3. Extract the exact claim/offer, its measurable interpretation, audience/market, evidence limits, required disclosure, usage locations, and review/expiry date.
4. Missing proof stays `none-on-file` in a proposal or open loop. Never turn `[needs source]` into Approved from the assertion itself.
5. Review pending proposal events in offset order. Accept with the proposal event ID and current `expected_revision`, or reject with evidence/rationale; history remains append-only.
6. Owner changes use `upsert` with optimistic revision. Expiry/withdrawal uses a dated state change or tombstone; never rewrite the original approval history.
7. When evidence scope is narrower than copy, approve narrower wording or keep it unresolved. Record estimates/proxies as such.
8. Regenerate `claims-ledger.md` / `offers.md` only from accepted projection state, then `verify claims`.

Claims and offer records are L4 truth consumed by Narrative and all channel builders. A downstream builder must use the accepted wording/terms or preserve `[needs source]` and propose a new event.

## Save Results

Require explicit write permission. Append schema-valid JSON through `python3 scripts/registry-events.py append claims <event.json>`; never edit the NDJSON stream manually. Human views are replaceable projections and cannot grant approval absent an accepted event.
