# Agent Compatibility — 70+ SKILL.md Hosts

All 120 skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard (`SKILL.md` + YAML frontmatter), so they run on every host that reads the format — natively or via the [`npx skills` installer](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). This page is the per-agent reference: how to install, what each host reads, and what degrades outside the Claude Code plugin. For getting *listed* on marketplaces, directories, and awesome-lists, see [registry-submissions.md](registry-submissions.md).

**Verified 2026-07** (end-to-end): `npx skills add` discovers and installs **120/120** skills from both a local clone and the GitHub remote. The installer reads the skill declarations straight from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` / `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — an official installer feature for Claude Code plugin repos — so the discipline-folder layout (`seo-geo/<phase>/<skill>/`) needs no mirror directory.

## Install

| Route | Command | Serves |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Claude Code plugin** (full suite) | `/plugin marketplace add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` → `/plugin install aaron-marketing@aaron` | skills + commands + hooks + memory + connectors + shared references |
| **Any other agent** (project) | `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` | skills, installed to `.agents/skills/` + your agent's own dir |
| **Any other agent** (global) | `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills -g` | same, user-wide |
| **Single skill** | `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills -s keyword-research` | one skill folder |
| **Force one agent** | `… -a codex` / `-a cursor` / `-a opencode` … | one host only |

`npx skills` auto-detects which agents are installed and symlinks each skill into the right directories (canonical copy in `.agents/skills/`, per-agent symlinks). Use `--copy` where symlinks are unsupported, `npx skills update` to pull new versions, `npx skills remove` to uninstall.

## skills.sh registry

[skills.sh](https://skills.sh) is the public registry + leaderboard behind the `npx skills` CLI. This bundle's live page: **<https://skills.sh/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills>**.

- **Listing is automatic**: skills appear and rank via the CLI's anonymous install telemetry (skill name, files, timestamp — nothing personal; opt out with `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`). There is no submission step — being installable *is* being listed, which is what CI's discovery-count guard protects.
- **Page layout is ours to define**: the repo-root [`skills.sh.json`](../skills.sh.json) ([official schema](https://skills.sh/schemas/skills.sh.schema.json)) groups the 120 skills into the eight discipline sections. Registry entries for pre-v12 skill names that were merged away (e.g. `seo-content-writer`, `meta-tags-optimizer`) persist from historical installs and cannot be deleted — `notGrouped: "bottom"` sinks them below the current catalog. CI asserts the groupings cover exactly the manifest-declared skill set, so a new skill can't ship ungrouped.
- **Search**: `npx skills find <query>` and `GET /api/v1/skills/search` match on name + description — every skill's `description` frontmatter is written with trigger phrases for this (see AGENTS.md authoring rules). The wider API (`/api/v1/…`, leaderboard/detail/audit endpoints) requires a Vercel OIDC token.
- **Well-known hosting** (`/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`, RFC 8615) is the registry's alternative to GitHub sources for skills served from your own domain — not applicable to this GitHub-hosted repo.

## ClawHub (OpenClaw's registry)

[ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) is publish-based — it does not crawl GitHub, so the bundle appears there only when its owner pushes versions. This repo ships the tooling:

```bash
npm i -g clawhub && clawhub login          # one-time; GitHub account required
bash scripts/publish-clawhub.sh --dry-run  # preview all 120 (verified: 120/120 resolve)
bash scripts/publish-clawhub.sh --i-accept-mit0   # publish, real versions from VERSIONS.md
```

The script walks the plugin.json skill list (same set every other host installs) and passes each skill's real frontmatter version, so ClawHub versions track this repo's per-skill versioning. Consumers then run `openclaw skills install @<handle>/<skill>` — or find the skills from Hermes via `--source clawhub`. Published skills undergo ClawHub's automated security scanning.

> ⚠️ **License gate**: ClawHub relicenses everything published there as **MIT-0** (free use/modify/redistribute, no attribution) — broader than this repo's Apache-2.0. The script refuses real publishes without an explicit `--i-accept-mit0`, and publishing is intentionally left as an owner decision, not CI automation.

OpenClaw also installs without ClawHub: `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills -a openclaw` (project `skills/` dir), since OpenClaw reads `<workspace>/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` natively.

## Hermes Agent install routes

Hermes pulls from multiple hubs; three routes work for this bundle, in order of preference:

1. **skills.sh source** (works today, full skill folders): `hermes skills install skills-sh/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/<skill-name>` — e.g. `…/keyword-research`; browse with `hermes skills search seo --source skills-sh`.
2. **ClawHub source** (after the owner publishes, see above): `hermes skills search marketing --source clawhub`.
3. **Direct URL** (single file, no `references/` bundled — the skill's own reference pack is lost, so prefer routes 1–2): `hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/main/<discipline>/<phase>/<skill>/SKILL.md`.

**Tap caveat**: `hermes skills tap add` assumes one `skills/` root per repo (one `path` override in `~/.hermes/.hub/taps.json`), which this multi-discipline layout deliberately doesn't have — use the skills.sh source instead; it resolves the same folders. Installed skills surface as slash commands (`/keyword-research …`) and are security-scanned at `community` trust on install. Every skill's `metadata.hermes` carries `tags`/`category` so `hermes skills browse` filters cleanly.

## SkillHub.cn (中文 Skills 社区)

[skillhub.cn](https://skillhub.cn) is the Chinese-market skills community (Tencent-hosted, TRACE-scored, human + automated review). Like ClawHub it is publish-based, with its **own frontmatter contract** on top of Agent Skills — every SKILL.md in this repo carries both, so the folders publish as-is:

| SkillHub field | Repo convention |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `slug` (required, globally unique) | `aaron-<skill-name>` — e.g. `aaron-keyword-research` (validator-enforced) |
| `displayName` (required) | bilingual: `"Keyword Research · 关键词研究"` |
| `summary` (recommended) | Chinese one-liner for the listing card |
| `version` / `license` / `homepage` | shared with the Agent Skills fields |

Publish flow (owner-run; machine spec at <https://skillhub.cn/ai/release.md>):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skillhub.cn/install/install.sh | bash -s -- --cli-only   # one-time
skillhub login --key "$SKILLHUB_KEY" --host https://api.skillhub.cn         # key: 个人中心 → API keys
bash scripts/publish-skillhub.sh --dry-run     # local pre-check, all 120 (verified: 120/120 pass)
bash scripts/publish-skillhub.sh               # publish all → platform review (pending_review)
```

Notes: publishing requires the account to have completed 实名认证 (real-name verification — a `403` means finish it in the browser first); each publish enters platform review before listing; consumers install with `skillhub install aaron-<skill-name>`. Keep the API key in the environment (`$SKILLHUB_KEY`) — never in the repo.

## Per-agent matrix

Paths below are each host's **native** skill directories (docs verified 2026-07; ✦ = also reads the cross-agent `.agents/skills/` convention, which is where `npx skills` installs).

| Agent | Project dir | Global dir | Notes |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/skills/` (+ plugin skills) | `~/.claude/skills/` | Prefer the plugin — it adds the 7 commands, hooks, memory, connectors. Does **not** read `.agents/skills/`; `npx skills` handles the mapping. |
| **OpenAI Codex** ✦ | `.agents/skills/` (CWD → repo root) | `~/.agents/skills/`, `/etc/codex/skills` | `AGENTS.md` context file supported. Launch-era `~/.codex/skills` no longer in current docs. |
| **Google Antigravity** ✦ | `.agents/skills/` | `~/.gemini/config/skills/` (CLI: `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`) | `description` drives activation; global `~/.agents/skills` **not** read. |
| **OpenCode** ✦ | `.opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` | Unknown frontmatter ignored; per-skill permissions in `opencode.json`. |
| **Cursor** ✦ | `.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` | Rules/commands converge on skills (`/migrate-to-skills`). |
| **OpenClaw** ✦ | `<ws>/skills/`, `<ws>/.agents/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/` | Parser reads single-line keys only — every skill's `metadata` is therefore a single-line JSON object (fully parsed, incl. `metadata.openclaw` emoji/homepage). Registry: [ClawHub](#clawhub-openclaws-registry). |
| **Hermes Agent** | — (config `skills.external_dirs`) | `~/.hermes/skills/` | Three install routes — [see below](#hermes-agent-install-routes). `metadata.hermes` carries tags/category for `hermes skills browse`. Skills double as slash commands (`/keyword-research`). Recommends ≤60-char descriptions; ours are longer by design (trigger-phrase routing) and load fine. |
| **Gemini CLI** ✦ | `.gemini/skills/` | `~/.gemini/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` | `.agents/` outranks `.gemini/` at the same tier; `/skills list\|enable\|disable`. |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** ✦ | `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` | `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` | Same skills work in Copilot cloud agent + code review; `gh skill` adds provenance frontmatter. |
| **Amp** ✦ | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.config/amp/skills/` | — |
| **Goose** ✦ | `.goose/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/` | Needs v1.25.0+ (Summon extension). |
| **Windsurf** ✦ | `.windsurf/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` | Docs now under docs.devin.ai (Cognition). |
| **Cline** | `.cline/skills/`, `.clinerules/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` | `~/.cline/skills/` | Docs don't list `.agents/skills/` — use `-a cline` so the installer places the agent dir. |
| **Roo Code** ✦ | `.roo/skills/` | `~/.roo/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` | Per-mode variants (`skills-<mode>/`); `.roo/` outranks `.agents/`. |
| **50+ more** ✦ | see [installer table](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents) | | Cline-likes, Warp, Zed, Kilo, Kiro, Trae, Qoder, OpenHands, Droid, Junie, … |

## Frontmatter portability

Every `SKILL.md` carries `name` (matches its directory, spec rule), `description` (≤1024 chars, spec limit), `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, plus the Claude Code extensions `when_to_use` and `argument-hint`. The agentskills.io integration guide instructs hosts to ignore unknown fields, and no researched host hard-fails on extras — the extensions are inert elsewhere.

`metadata` is always a **single-line strict-JSON object** (valid YAML flow mapping, so every spec parser reads it identically). This is deliberate: OpenClaw's frontmatter parser reads single-line keys only — a YAML block map under `metadata:` is invisible to it. The object carries the repo's own keys (`author`, `version`, `discipline`, `phase`, `geo-relevance`) plus two documented host extensions on every skill: `metadata.hermes` (`tags`/`category` for Hermes browse/filter) and `metadata.openclaw` (`emoji`/`homepage` for the OpenClaw macOS UI). The validator fails block-map metadata, so the guarantee holds for future skills.

One hard rule the ecosystem enforces silently: frontmatter must be **valid YAML**. In single-quoted scalars an apostrophe must be doubled (`designer''s`) — one unescaped apostrophe made a skill invisible to every spec parser until v12.7.0. `scripts/validate-skill.sh` now checks for this class, and CI asserts the installer still discovers the full declared count.

## What degrades outside the Claude Code plugin

A standalone install bundles **only each skill's folder** (its `SKILL.md` + own `references/`). Everything below ships with the plugin (or a full `git clone`) instead:

| Shared resource | Standalone behavior |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Repo-root `references/` (auditor runbook, CORE-EEAT / CITE / C³ / ROAS / SEND / RAMP / ECHO benchmarks, skill contract, state model) | Relative links break. The 7 auditor gates carry an explicit fallback: fetch the file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/main/references/<filename>` or ask for a repo clone — they never score without the runbook. `social-quality-auditor` follows the same pattern, reading `auditor-runbook.md` + `echo-benchmark.md` with a raw.githubusercontent fallback. Non-gate skills inline their essential rules, so broken links are cosmetic. |
| `scripts/connectors/*.py` (keyless data helpers) | Not bundled. Every skill is designed Tier-1: it runs on user-provided data with no connector. Clone the repo to use the connectors. |
| The 7 `/aaron-marketing:*` commands | Claude Code plugin only. On other hosts, describe the goal — skill descriptions carry the routing triggers. |
| Hooks (session hot-cache injection, Artifact Gate) + temperature memory | Claude Code plugin only. Gates still emit the full handoff schema; it just isn't machine-validated. |
| Cross-skill handoffs (`../<skill>/SKILL.md` links) | Literal paths may break, but handoffs reference skills **by name** — any host with the sibling skill installed routes fine. Install the full bundle rather than single skills to keep chains intact. |

**Positioning in one line**: Claude Code plugin = the operated product (gates enforced, memory persisted, connectors wired); any other host = the same 120 skill procedures, self-contained.

## For contributors

- Never mirror skills into `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` inside this repo — manifest-driven discovery already covers every host, and committed symlinks would not survive iCloud/Windows checkouts.
- Adding a skill? Its `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` entries make it installable everywhere; CI's discovery-count guard fails if the installer and the manifest disagree.
- Keep `name` == directory name, `description` ≤1024 chars, apostrophes in single-quoted YAML doubled, and `metadata` a single-line JSON object (with the `hermes` + `openclaw` extension keys). `bash scripts/validate-skill.sh <skill-dir>` checks all of it.
- Publishing to ClawHub is an owner-only, license-acknowledged action (`scripts/publish-clawhub.sh`) — never automate it in CI.
