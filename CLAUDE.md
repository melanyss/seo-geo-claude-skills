# Aaron Marketing Skills — Claude Code Context

This plugin provides **69 skills and 5 commands** across four marketing disciplines — SEO/GEO, influencer marketing (IMPACT), Paid Ads (ROAS), and Email Marketing (SEND) — plus a shared protocol layer. All 69 skills follow one shared contract: trigger, quick start, skill contract, handoff summary, and next best skill. Skills are auto-loaded by context; commands are invoked with `/aaron-marketing:`. Current bundle version: `12.5.0` (see [VERSIONS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/VERSIONS.md)).

> Umbrella repo, renamed from `seo-geo-claude-skills` (stars/forks/issues/history carried over by the GitHub rename). The SEO/GEO-only product still lives, unchanged, at the original [seo-geo-claude-skills](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills) URL as a standalone repo.

## Skills by Phase

The four disciplines share one **meta-lifecycle** spine (an approximate bridge — each adapts the granularity to its own workflow, so phase *counts* and exact semantics differ by design):

| Meta-stage | SEO/GEO | Influencer (IMPACT) | Paid (ROAS) | Email (SEND) |
|------------|---------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Understand** | research | discover | Research | Setup |
| **Plan / create** | build | plan | Orchestrate | Engage |
| **Activate / optimize** | optimize | activate | Activate | Nurture |
| **Measure** | monitor | measure | Scale | Deliver |
| **Cross-cutting** | the **protocol layer** (entity/creator/claims/consent truth registries · memory) serves all four; the 5 auditor-class gates live in their disciplines | | | |

Notes: "Activate" means creator outreach in IMPACT but account-gating in ROAS — same word, discipline-specific scope. All four disciplines now live under a discipline folder — SEO/GEO under `seo-geo/<phase>/` (research/build/optimize/monitor), influencer under `influencer/<phase>/` (discover/plan/activate/measure), paid under `ad/<phase>/` (research/orchestrate/activate/scale), and email under `email/<phase>/` (setup/engage/nurture/deliver).

**SEO/GEO (16):**

| Phase | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| **Research** | `keyword-research`, `competitor-analysis`, `serp-analysis`, `content-gap-analysis` |
| **Build** | `content-writer` (merge: seo-content-writer + content-refresher), `geo-content-optimizer`, `serp-markup-builder` (merge: meta-tags-optimizer + schema-markup-generator), `page-play-builder` (merge: programmatic + parasite + comparison + local SEO, 4 modes) |
| **Optimize** | `content-quality-auditor`, `technical-seo-checker`, `on-page-seo-auditor`, `site-structure-optimizer` (merge: internal-linking-optimizer + site-architecture) |
| **Monitor** | `domain-authority-auditor`, `rank-tracker`, `performance-monitor` (merge: performance-reporter + alert-manager), `offsite-signal-analyzer` (merge: backlink-analyzer + ai-traffic) |

**Protocol layer — cross-cutting (5):** shared truth & memory machinery outside the discipline phase-flows — 4 discipline-anchored truth registries (`entity-optimizer` → SEO/GEO, `creator-registry` → influencer, `offer-claims-registry` → paid, `consent-registry` → email) plus the cross-discipline `memory-management`. Counted separately. The auditor-class **gate role** spans 5 skills, all discipline-resident and counted there: `content-quality-auditor` (seo-geo/optimize/), `domain-authority-auditor` (seo-geo/monitor/), `content-reviewer` (influencer/activate/), `ad-account-auditor` (ad/activate/), `email-quality-auditor` (email/deliver/).

| Group | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| **Protocol** | `entity-optimizer`, `creator-registry`, `offer-claims-registry`, `consent-registry`, `memory-management` |

**Influencer — IMPACT (16):** phases collapse 6 → 4 — the old insight + map fold into **discover**, activate + convert fold into **activate**, and track becomes **measure**.

| Phase | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| **Discover** | `audience-mapper` (merge: audience-analyzer + niche-researcher), `trend-spotter`, `influencer-discovery`, `fit-scorer` |
| **Plan** | `competitor-tracker` (moved from map), `campaign-planner`, `brief-generator`, `budget-optimizer` |
| **Activate** | `outreach-manager`, `content-reviewer`, `contract-helper`, `content-amplifier` (merge: content-amplifier + ugc-repurposer, from convert) |
| **Measure** | `landing-optimizer` (from convert), `performance-analyzer`, `roi-calculator`, `report-generator` |

**Paid Ads — ROAS (16):** phase directories under `ad/` follow the ROAS loop (Research → Orchestrate → Activate → Scale).

| Phase | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| **Research** | `campaign-architect`, `audience-segment-builder`, `search-term-miner`, `product-feed-optimizer` |
| **Orchestrate** | `ad-creative-builder`, `ad-test-designer`, `bid-strategy-planner`, `landing-experience-checker` |
| **Activate** | `ad-account-auditor` (RQS gate + launch go/no-go mode), `conversion-signal-qa`, `placement-exclusion-manager`, `conversion-value-mapper` |
| **Scale** | `paid-measurement-loop`, `attribution-reconciler`, `budget-pacing-monitor`, `fatigue-frequency-manager` |

Reused cross-discipline (counted in their home phases, not duplicated): `budget-optimizer` (spend allocation), `landing-optimizer` (post-click), `roi-calculator` (return math), `report-generator`, `performance-analyzer`.

**Email — SEND (16):** phase directories under `email/` follow the SEND loop (Setup → Engage → Nurture → Deliver). Use-case-agnostic (B2C lifecycle / B2B cold outbound / newsletter-creator); the goal-weight column selects the emphasis.

| Phase | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| **Setup** | `deliverability-qa` (SEND-S, the S1 auth pre-flight), `list-segment-builder` (segments + suppression), `list-growth-designer` (acquisition strategy + compliant capture-flow spec), `list-hygiene-monitor` |
| **Engage** | `email-creative-builder` (subject/preheader/body/CTA, message-matched, claims-ledger-aware), `subject-line-lab`, `email-render-builder`, `dynamic-content-personalizer` |
| **Nurture** | `email-sequence-designer` (lifecycle flows + frequency governance), `newsletter-monetization-planner` (paid-sub/sponsorship/referral economics), `preference-frequency-manager`, `reactivation-specialist` |
| **Deliver** | `email-quality-auditor` (EQS gate + pre-send go/no-go mode), `send-experiment-designer` (A/B + send-time + hold-out design; renamed from send-test-designer), `inbox-placement-monitor`, `cold-outbound-sequencer` |

Reused cross-discipline (counted in their home phases, not duplicated): `audience-mapper` (persona/lifecycle-stage), `landing-optimizer` (post-click), `roi-calculator` (revenue-per-send), `report-generator`, `performance-analyzer`, `offer-claims-registry` (D1 claim compliance). The email truth registry `consent-registry` lives in the protocol layer.

*Scope edge:* `list-growth-designer` (setup) owns the acquisition **strategy** + the compliant opt-in capture-flow **spec**; the signup-form/popup **UX** stays with `landing-optimizer`, the opt-in **record** with `consent-registry`, the confirmation **flow** with `email-sequence-designer`, and referral growth-loop **economics** with `newsletter-monetization-planner`.

## One-Shot Commands

**Five commands.** `/aaron-marketing:auto` infers intent across all disciplines; each discipline has one explicit entrypoint. Not sure? Use `/aaron-marketing:auto`:

```
/aaron-marketing:auto      — Infer marketing intent across all disciplines and run the smallest useful workflow (add --deep for exhaustive/stress-test)
/aaron-marketing:seo-geo   — SEO/GEO end-to-end (--mode research|create|audit|track; per-mode flags preserved: --brief/--series/--refresh/--publish/--meta/--schema/--type, --full/--tech/--visibility/--authority, --alert/--report/--remember/--period, --competitors/--map)
/aaron-marketing:impact    — Influencer (IMPACT): discover / plan / activate / measure (--phase to force a stage)
/aaron-marketing:ad      — Paid ads (ROAS loop): research / orchestrate / activate / scale (--phase to force a stage)
/aaron-marketing:email     — Email (SEND loop): setup / engage / nurture / deliver (--phase to force a stage)
```

## Quality Frameworks

- **CORE-EEAT** ([references/core-eeat-benchmark.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/core-eeat-benchmark.md)): 80-item content quality framework (8 dimensions). GEO Score = CORE avg; SEO Score = EEAT avg. Three veto items: T04, C01, R10.
- **CITE** ([references/cite-domain-rating.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/cite-domain-rating.md)): 40-item domain authority framework (4 dimensions). Three veto items: T03, T05, T09.
- **C³** ([references/c3-benchmark.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/c3-benchmark.md)): influencer marketing framework — Creator/Content/Campaign scored on ACE/ART/ROI (9 dimensions). Veto items: ACE A2/C1/E2, ART T1/T2. CVI = (ACE×ART×ROI)^(1/3).
- **ROAS** ([references/roas-benchmark.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/roas-benchmark.md)): paid ads framework — R (Return), O (Offer), A (Audience), S (Spend-efficiency). RQS = arithmetic weighted-mean rollup (like CITE). Veto items: R1/R2/O1/O2/A1.
- **SEND** ([references/send-benchmark.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/send-benchmark.md)): email marketing framework — S (Sender-integrity/deliverability), E (Engagement), N (Nurture/lifecycle), D (Direct-response/conversion). EQS = arithmetic goal-weighted-mean rollup (like ROAS). Veto items: S1/S2/N1/D1.

## Operating Contract

- Shared contract reference: [references/skill-contract.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md)
- Shared state model: [references/state-model.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/state-model.md)
- Protocol roles (role assignments — the `protocol/` directory itself is 5 skills; the 5 gates live in their home disciplines; `content-reviewer`/`ad-account-auditor`/`email-quality-auditor` play gate roles but are counted under their home disciplines):
  - `content-quality-auditor` = publish readiness gate
  - `domain-authority-auditor` = citation trust gate
  - `content-reviewer` = C³ ART gate
  - `ad-account-auditor` = ROAS gate
  - `email-quality-auditor` = SEND gate
  - `entity-optimizer` = canonical entity profile
  - `creator-registry` = canonical creator roster/dossier (influencer truth SSOT)
  - `offer-claims-registry` = offer & claim-substantiation record (paid truth SSOT)
  - `consent-registry` = per-subject consent/suppression record (email truth SSOT)
  - `memory-management` = campaign memory loop
- Hook automation: `hooks/hooks.json` — command-backed hooks for SessionStart (startup/resume/clear/compact: injects sanitized hot-cache + an open-loops pointer), UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse (hot-cache size warning + auditor Artifact Gate), and a Stop hook that is a no-op (exits silently)
- Temperature memory: HOT (`memory/hot-cache.md`, 80 lines, auto-loaded) / WARM (`memory/` subdirs) / COLD (`memory/archive/`)
- Dual truncation: HOT tier limited to 80 lines AND 25KB (whichever triggers first)

## Inter-Skill Handoff

When a skill recommends running another, pass the standard shape from `references/skill-contract.md` §Handoff Summary Format: status (DONE/DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/BLOCKED/NEEDS_INPUT), objective, key findings/output, evidence (each labeled Measured/User-provided/Estimated), assumptions, open loops, and the recommended next skill. The 5 auditor-class gates additionally emit `cap_applied`, `raw_overall_score`, and `final_overall_score` per `references/auditor-runbook.md` §1.

If `memory-management` is active, prior audit results load automatically from the hot cache.

## Tool Connector Pattern

Skills use `~~category` placeholders (e.g., `~~SEO tool`, `~~analytics`). Every skill works without any integrations (Tier 1). [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md) documents a verified **free/keyless data recipe for each category** — Google Search Console & GA4 (own data), PageSpeed/CrUX, Wikidata SPARQL, Common Crawl, Wayback CDX, Open PageRank, advertools, plus **Resend** for `~~email platform` (free-tier key; `scripts/connectors/resend.py` — domain-auth status, seed-test sends, suppression sync, broadcasts; mutating subcommands dry-run by default, `--live` to execute) and two **keyless hosted fetchers** — **Firecrawl** for `~~web crawler`/`~~SEO tool` (`scripts/connectors/firecrawl.py` — live SERP + JS-rendered scrape + site map, ~1,000 free credits/mo) and **Tavily** for `~~AI monitor`(proxy)/`~~SEO tool`/`~~trend database` (`scripts/connectors/tavily.py` — scored search, `--answer` AI-citation probe, news pulse, URL extract), both with a local robots.txt pre-flight and `--own-site` override — plus three **keyless public-API connectors**: `doh.py` (DNS-over-HTTPS email-auth records — the any-ESP SEND-S1 record pull), `pageviews.py` (Wikipedia attention series), and `gdelt.py` (GDELT global news mentions, `~~brand monitor`; ≥5s between calls) — so skills can pull real data with zero paid-tool dependency. MCP servers catalogued in `docs/mcp-catalog.json` (Ahrefs, Semrush, SE Ranking, SISTRIX, SimilarWeb, the self-hosted free **OpenSEO** suite, Cloudflare, Vercel, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Webflow, Sanity, Contentful, Slack, Resend, the keyless Firecrawl and Tavily) are an **opt-in** Tier 2/3 automation layer — the catalog is kept outside the plugin-root `.mcp.json` path that Claude Code auto-registers (and `plugin.json` carries no `mcpServers` key), so installing the plugin adds nothing to the user's `/mcp` list; users copy the entries they want into their own MCP config.

## Contribution Rules

- All `SKILL.md` files must include: `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata` frontmatter. Recommended: `when_to_use` (underscores, not hyphens) and `argument-hint`.
- `plugin.json` must include: `name` (the spec-required identifier) and `description` at top level, plus `id` (the marketplace identity key downstream tooling references). Commands are auto-discovered from `./commands/`; skills are listed as directory paths.
- Keep each `SKILL.md` focused — move long detail into `references/` subdirectories. The five auditor-class gate skills (`content-quality-auditor`, `domain-authority-auditor`, `content-reviewer`, `ad-account-auditor`, `email-quality-auditor` — discipline-resident, not protocol-layer) `Read references/auditor-runbook.md` at activation (the framework-agnostic SSOT: handoff schema, cap method, Artifact Gate, translation format) via a plugin-relative path, and keep only their **framework-specific** §2 worked examples, §3 guardrails, and §5 veto-ID rows inline (CORE-EEAT / CITE / C³ ART / ROAS / SEND diverge and must not be byte-identical). All intra-repo links in `SKILL.md`/`references/` are plugin-relative paths, never `blob/main` GitHub URLs — the validator enforces this.
- High-volume `references/` packs should prefer compact starter templates, step matrices, and checklists over long worked outlines. Keep canonical examples only where they materially improve execution quality.
- After updating a skill, keep the tracking files in step — the **authoritative 8-file list** lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md §6](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (`VERSIONS.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, the root `marketplace.json` and its `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` mirror, `README.md`, this `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/README.zh.md`).
- Design philosophy: skills are content (Markdown). Allowed code: the bash validator (`scripts/validate-skill.sh`) and **zero-dependency Python-stdlib connector helpers** under `scripts/connectors/` that pull public/own data locally so skills don't need external tools (see [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md)). No third-party / `pip` dependencies.
- Keep the shared contract and state-model language consistent with `references/skill-contract.md` and `references/state-model.md`.
- Branch naming: `feature/skill-name`, `fix/skill-name`, `docs/description`

## CLI Tools

System PATH in Claude Code sessions is minimal (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`). Tools installed via Homebrew or npm are NOT on PATH by default. Always use absolute paths:

- **gh** (GitHub CLI): `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`
- **node**: `/usr/local/bin/node`
- **bun**: `~/.bun/bin/bun`

Or prepend PATH at start of command: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"; gh ...`

### GitHub Release

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "title" --notes "body"
