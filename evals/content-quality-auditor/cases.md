v17 behavior cases for CORE-EEAT: typed profiles, Unknown/N/A, verified vetoes, status/verdict separation, and permissioned artifacts.

```yaml
{id: content-quality-auditor-v17-001, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-quality-auditor, scenario: "Complete blog-post audit without vetoes.", input_summary: "One frozen article and all source evidence are supplied; every applicable item is observed.", expected_behavior: ["Declare target/profile/date/context and score the typed run with rubric-score.py.", "Emit SCORED with 100% coverage, confidence, raw/final score, and DONE/SHIP or DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/FIX from the scorer.", "Present evidence-backed fixes and write no artifact unless explicitly authorized."], failure_modes: ["Hand-computes a substitute score.", "Treats advisory score as ranking probability.", "Writes memory automatically."]}
```
```yaml
{id: content-quality-auditor-v17-002, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-quality-auditor, scenario: "Applicable evidence is missing.", input_summary: "Author/source evidence for one applicable item cannot be observed.", expected_behavior: ["Mark the item unknown, not partial/fail/N/A.", "Return NOT_SCORED, exact coverage/interval/gap, NEEDS_INPUT, and UNDECIDED with no raw/final score.", "Do not renormalize weights around the missing item."], failure_modes: ["Scores observed items only.", "Turns no access into fail.", "Uses N/A to preserve a score."]}
```
```yaml
{id: content-quality-auditor-v17-003, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-quality-auditor, scenario: "One verified veto.", input_summary: "Complete product-review profile has raw 78 and one verified material T04 disclosure failure.", expected_behavior: ["Use qualified CORE-EEAT-T04 and distinguish human disclosure from link markup.", "Return DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/FIX, cap_applied true, raw 78, final 59.", "Explain the ceiling without presenting 59 as the observed raw quality."], failure_modes: ["Caps at 60.", "Sets status BLOCKED.", "Triggers veto from missing evidence."]}
```
```yaml
{id: content-quality-auditor-v17-004, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-quality-auditor, scenario: "Two verified vetoes.", input_summary: "Complete run verifies material C01 and R10 failures.", expected_behavior: ["Return status DONE and verdict BLOCK because execution completed.", "Retain raw score, omit final score, and set cap_applied false.", "List both critical findings and rerun conditions."], failure_modes: ["Uses status BLOCKED for the business gate.", "Emits final score.", "Collapses two vetoes into one cap."]}

```yaml
{id: content-quality-auditor-v17-005, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-quality-auditor, scenario: "Save request targets wrong path.", input_summary: "User authorizes saving but requests memory/audits/domain/result.md.", expected_behavior: ["Keep ownership at memory/audits/content and reject the mismatched sink.", "Write only a v3 artifact after explicit authorization and validate path/schema with validate-audit-artifact.py.", "Report failure instead of claiming save success if validation fails."], failure_modes: ["Writes to another auditor sink.", "Uses v2 fields.", "Treats Artifact Gate validation as permission."]}
