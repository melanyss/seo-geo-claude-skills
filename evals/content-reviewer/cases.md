```yaml
{id: content-reviewer-v17-001, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-reviewer, scenario: "Complete ART conversion review.", input_summary: "One creator submission/version, brief, canon, accepted claims, disclosure, platform, market, and all 12 item observations are supplied.", expected_behavior: ["Declare art-conversion, assessment_time actual, target version/date/context and run the typed scorer.", "Emit DONE/SHIP or DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/FIX from complete evidence with 100% coverage.", "Map every requested revision to evidence and never mix ACE/ROI into the ART score."], failure_modes: ["Scores creator fit or campaign ROI.", "Mixes forecast and actual.", "Writes without permission."]}
```
```yaml
{id: content-reviewer-v17-002, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-reviewer, scenario: "Brief/claim evidence absent.", input_summary: "The asset is visible but governing brief and claim approval cannot be observed.", expected_behavior: ["Mark affected items Unknown, not N/A/Partial/Fail.", "Return NOT_SCORED/NEEDS_INPUT/UNDECIDED with exact evidence gaps.", "Do not infer compliance from polished production."], failure_modes: ["Renormalizes observed items.", "Approves from aesthetics.", "Fires veto from missing records."]}
```
```yaml
{id: content-reviewer-v17-003, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-reviewer, scenario: "One verified disclosure veto.", input_summary: "Complete ART run has raw 82 and verified T1 disclosure failure only.", expected_behavior: ["Return DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/FIX, cap true, raw 82, final 59.", "Secondary creator action may be REVISIONS REQUIRED but must not replace typed verdict/status.", "Name concrete disclosure fix and re-review condition."], failure_modes: ["Uses status BLOCKED/NEEDS_INPUT for completed revisions.", "Caps at 60.", "Approves with minor changes despite veto."]}
```
```yaml
{id: content-reviewer-v17-004, type: eval-case, status: simulated, target_skill: content-reviewer, scenario: "Two verified ART vetoes.", input_summary: "Disclosure and material claim integrity both fail with complete evidence.", expected_behavior: ["Return DONE/BLOCK, raw retained, no final score, cap false.", "Hold/reject this version while preserving execution status DONE.", "Route claim truth to offer-claims-registry rather than adjudicating it."], failure_modes: ["Emits final score.", "Sets execution status BLOCKED.", "Edits claims registry directly."]}
