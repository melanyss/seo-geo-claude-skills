**Scope**: the layered latency model below (proxy vs outcome) is **SEO/GEO-specific**. The cross-discipline design and decision protocol applies to every discipline. Other disciplines use their own unit, outcome truth set, latency, and guardrails; they do not inherit the crawler/citation layers.

## The problem this exists to fix

SEO/GEO outcomes are **delayed** (a page change surfaces in an AI answer or a ranking only
after the engine re-crawls and re-indexes) and **confounded** (your number also moves because
the engine changed, a competitor changed, or the category shifted). So a raw before/after on
the final outcome is rarely attributable to your edit. The fix is not "measure faster" — some
things genuinely cannot be measured fast — it is to **separate the fast proxy from the slow
outcome, label which is which, and attribute the slow ones against a control.**

## The core distinction: proxy vs outcome, four latency layers

The single most common mistake (we made it ourselves) is collapsing two opposite-latency things
into one claim like "GEO is minute-level testable". It is not. It splits cleanly:

| Layer | What it measures | Latency | Proxy or outcome | How you test it | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Crawler access** | Can the AI/search bots even fetch and parse the page? | **Instant** | Precondition (neither) | Fetch-as-bot + robots eval + your server logs | `robots.py` (exists), `botlog.py` *(proposed)* |
| **2. Citability** | *Given the page is retrieved*, is it extractable / quotable / answer-shaped? | **Minutes** | **Proxy** for GEO | Hand the URL/content to a live-fetch engine, ask the target question, score the answer | `citations.py probe` *(proposed)* + `ledger.py` |
| **3. Surfacing** | Does an engine cite you for a bare query, *unprompted*? | **Days–weeks** | **Outcome** (GEO) | Ask a fixed query panel WITHOUT giving the URL; record citations over time vs a control | `citations.py surface` *(proposed)* + `ledger.py` |
| **4. Rankings / clicks** | Search position, impressions, CTR | **Weeks–months** | **Outcome** (SEO) | GSC / rank data snapshotted over time vs a control | `gsc.py` *(proposed)* + `ledger.py` |

> **⚠️ The error this table prevents:** never read a missing citation (layer 3) as "my content
> is bad" until layer 1 says the bot actually fetched a 200. "Not crawled yet" and "crawled but
> not chosen" look identical in the answer box and have completely different fixes. Check access
> first.

## Layer 1 — Crawler access (instant, fully in your control)

The cheapest, fastest signal, and a **precondition** for everything below: if the bot can't
fetch or render the page, no amount of content quality matters.

- **Test:** request the page as each relevant bot UA and confirm a `200` with the content present
  in the raw HTML (not JS-injected). Evaluate robots.txt for each UA group. Parse your own access
  logs for actual bot hits per URL.
- **Bots to check** (UA tokens drift — verify current values, do not hard-code blindly): training
  crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot), live/user fetchers (ChatGPT-User, Claude-User,
  Perplexity-User), search-index crawlers (OAI-SearchBot, Claude-SearchBot), and Google
  (Googlebot powers AI Overviews; **Google-Extended is an opt-out *token*, not a separate crawler**,
  and does not change crawl timing).
- **What green here proves:** only that you are reachable. It is insurance against wasting two
  weeks discovering ClaudeBot was being 403'd — **not** evidence you will be cited.
- **robots caveat:** the live/user fetchers do not all obey robots.txt — `Perplexity-User`, in
  particular, behaves like a real-time browser and may fetch even when `PerplexityBot` (its
  background indexing crawler) is disallowed. So a robots.txt block reduces *surfacing* (L3, the
  index path) without necessarily stopping an explicit-URL *probe* (L2). Test access per UA, not in
  aggregate.

## Layer 2 — Citability: the fast loop (minutes, but a proxy)

**Why it *can* be fast — and the exception that bites:** when you hand the engine a **specific
URL**, a live-fetch path does a real HTTP GET at query time, so it sees the version you just
deployed and you bypass the crawl/index lag. This holds for **Perplexity-User** and **Claude's
`web_fetch`** (Claude-User UA). It does **not** hold universally: **ChatGPT, even with web access
on, preferentially answers from its own cached index rather than re-fetching**, and Claude's
`web_search` (as opposed to `web_fetch`) reads a search index, not your live page. So the
minutes-fast property belongs to the **explicit-URL live-fetch path**, not to "browsing" in
general — verify per engine, do not assume a universal bypass.

**What it actually measures:** extractability, quotable self-contained chunks, a direct answer
near the top, schema/structure the model can parse — i.e. **exactly what the build-phase GEO work
(`geo-content-optimizer`, schema, Q&A blocks) changes.** This is why iterating on those changes
*can* be fast.

**What it does NOT measure — state this every time:** whether the engine will *retrieve* you
unprompted. It tests "if retrieved, is it good," not "will it be retrieved." It is a **proxy** for
GEO, never the outcome.

**Method (probe):**
1. Define a fixed **prompt panel** of target questions (the queries you want to be cited for).
2. Run each prompt while supplying the URL/content — but **only trust the result as a test of your
   current page if a live fetch actually happened.** Confirm it: your access log should show the
   `Perplexity-User` / `Claude-User` hit during the probe. If no hit appears (ChatGPT cache,
   Claude `web_search`, any index path), you scored a *cached* copy — label it as such, do not call
   it a fresh-content test.
3. Score each answer: was the page cited? was a claim quoted verbatim? was the answer correct and
   attributable to your content? (binary per dimension is fine).
4. Because model output is **stochastic, sample** — run each prompt N times and record the **rate**,
   not a single yes/no. Snapshot the rates to `ledger.py` so successive content edits show a delta.

**Honest friction:** there is no clean, free API that reports "who did ChatGPT cite." Use the
Perplexity API where it exists; otherwise this layer is **semi-manual** (run the panel through each
engine's own interface/API). `ledger.py` structures the results; it does not automate the asking.

## Layer 3 — Surfacing: the slow loop (days–weeks, the real GEO outcome)

The thing users actually want — "does ChatGPT/AIO/Perplexity recommend me when someone asks" — is
**gated by each engine's own crawl + index refresh, which you cannot force.** There is no
"recrawl now" button for the AI-specific bots. Google's Search Console URL Inspection → Request
Indexing nudges *Google's* index only (rate-limited, no guarantee), and AI Overview inclusion is
decided separately on top of that. So surfacing is **as slow and confounded as SEO ranking.**

**Method (surface):**
1. Ask the fixed query panel **without supplying the URL**.
2. Record, per engine, whether your domain is cited / linked / named, and in what position.
3. Snapshot to `ledger.py` on a schedule (e.g. weekly).

**Attribution requires a control — this is non-negotiable for layers 3–4.** Your citation rate
moves for reasons that are not your edit (the engine retrained, a competitor published, the SERP
feature changed). So measure a **holdout in parallel**: an unchanged page of yours, a sibling URL,
or a competitor, run through the same panel. **Report delta-vs-control, not raw delta.** A raw
"+15% citations" means nothing if the whole category rose 15%.

**Horizon:** fix the measurement window *before* you start (e.g. 2–6 weeks) and do not react to
day-to-day noise inside it. Reading surfacing daily is reading noise.

## Layer 4 — SEO outcomes (weeks–months, same discipline)

Impressions / position / clicks via GSC (`gsc.py`, proposed) snapshotted to `ledger.py`, read
against a control and a horizon, accounting for seasonality. Mechanically identical to layer 3 —
just a different data source and a longer window.

## The loop (applies to layers 2–4)

1. **Baseline** — `ledger.py record` the relevant signal *before* the change.
2. **One attributable change** — make a single change, or a clearly labeled batch. Two changes at
   once destroy attribution.
3. **Wait the layer's latency** — minutes (L2), the fixed horizon (L3/L4). Re-snapshot.
4. **`ledger.py diff` / `trend` against the control**, not against zero.
5. **Label every number** — `Measured` / `Estimated` / `Proxy-for-<outcome>`. Never render a
   layer-2 proxy as if it were a layer-3 outcome. (This is the same labeling rule the skills already
   carry, applied to time-series.)

## What this protocol does NOT give you (read before trusting a number)

- **No certainty.** A proxy (L2) can improve while the outcome (L3) does not, and vice-versa.
  Citability is necessary, not sufficient, for surfacing.
- **No fast surfacing.** Layers 3–4 stay slow. Any claim of a minute-level "will I be cited /
  ranked" loop is false — we made that claim once and it was wrong.
- **No attribution without a control.** A raw before/after on a confounded outcome is a story,
  not evidence.
- **Single runs are noise.** L2 is stochastic; sample and report rates.
- **Collection is semi-manual.** The tools structure and diff the data; they do not, for the AI
  engines, automate the asking.

## Cross-Discipline Decision Protocol

Every monitored change is judged on a fixed schedule against a defensible counterfactual, then promoted, kept testing, rolled back, or marked unproven by the named decision owner. Statistical software supplies evidence; it does not own the business verdict.

### Register Before Exposure

Record the unit of randomization/analysis, population and exclusions, control and candidate, primary metric, guardrails, metric direction, outcome truth source, attribution rule, conversion lag, hypothesis, minimum practically important effect, alpha/confidence, power/precision target, sample plan, multiplicity or sequential-testing correction, start/stop/read dates, and decision owner. A plan written after looking at outcomes is exploratory, not confirmatory.

**Readback windows** (set before the change; do not react inside the window):

| Change type | Readbacks |
|---|---|
| Content refresh (existing page) | 7 / 14 / 28 / 56 days |
| New content / new asset | 14 / 28 / 56 / 90 days |
| Technical fix | daily ×7, then 28 |
| AEO/GEO surfacing | weekly |
| Influencer activation | per post + 7 / 30 days |
| Paid campaign change | exit learning phase first, then 7 / 14 days |

**Required readback fields**: experiment/change ID · preregistration version · owner · target/population · control and candidate windows · sample/exclusions · sources and provenance · primary metric and guardrails · attribution/lag · effect and uncertainty · statistical method · data-quality incidents · decision · rationale · next patch · next readback date.

### Method-Appropriate Evidence

- **Binary rates**: use a prespecified two-proportion method, effect estimate/interval, and practical-effect bar. `experiment.py proportion` returns a two-sided pooled z-test, per-arm Wilson intervals, an absolute-lift interval, and separate statistical/practical flags.
- **Continuous/skewed metrics**: report sample sizes, robust summaries, a rank test where its assumptions match the estimand, and a bootstrap effect interval. A Mann-Whitney test is not a test of mean difference and must not be described as one.
- **Time series or non-randomized changes**: use a defensible matched control, interrupted-series, difference-in-differences, or other stated design. A generic A/B p-value does not repair confounding.
- **Small or dependent samples**: remain exploratory unless the chosen exact, clustered, paired, or hierarchical method supports the design.

`alpha=0.05`, `power=0.80`, and a 15% relative practical-lift reference are defaults only when no better domain-specific policy exists. They are not universal truths. Declare any default before exposure and report sensitivity. For a zero control rate, relative lift is undefined; use a preregistered absolute effect.

Use [`scripts/connectors/experiment.py`](../scripts/connectors/experiment.py) for stdlib deterministic calculations. Inputs are user-provided observations; p-values, intervals, power, and effect estimates are **Calculated**. The helper deliberately emits no `promote`, `rollback`, or winner verdict.

### Decision Ownership

**Promote** only when the precommitted primary evidence and practical-effect bar are met, guardrails are acceptable, attribution/data quality is intact, and the decision owner accepts the operational tradeoff. **Keep testing** only under a registered continuation/sequential rule. **Rollback** may be immediate for a safety, legal, reliability, or material business guardrail even before efficacy is resolved. Otherwise record **Unproven**; absence of significance is not proof of equivalence.

Do not promote when sample/precision is inadequate, attribution is dirty, exclusions changed post hoc, seasonality or interference explains the move, collection failed mid-window, repeated peeking/multiplicity is unhandled, or only a proxy improved while the declared outcome did not.

## Per-discipline latency notes

- **SEO/GEO** — the four-layer model above (crawler access → citability → surfacing → rankings). Proxy (L2) is minutes; outcomes (L3/L4) are weeks. Always read against a control.
- **Influencer** — content has a short head (first 24–48h decides most reach) then a long tail; judge a post on its own platform analytics vs the creator's recent median, not vs another creator. ROI/CVI roll up per the [C³ framework](c3-benchmark.md).
- **Paid ads** — auction feedback is near-instant, so the latency problem inverts vs GEO: the slow parts are **conversion lag** (a click today converts days later) and **attribution windows** (Meta 7-day-click vs Google last-click are not comparable — normalize before diffing), plus **learning-phase noise** (editing a campaign still in learning resets it; do not read or change it until it exits). Never compare cross-platform ROAS without normalizing window + currency. Scores roll up per the ROAS framework (`references/roas-benchmark.md`, added in the Paid Ads wave).

## Frequency ceiling by objective

Read against the **early-flight baseline**, not a raw last-day dip (per the paid latency note above). Frequency is impressions ÷ reach over a stated window — a 7-day rolling window unless the export says otherwise. The bands below are **Estimated** starting points, not measured thresholds: they say *where to start looking for decay*, not a hard cutoff. Confirm the actual breach by reading the CTR/CVR slope, and let the observed decay — not the number alone — call fatigue vs saturation. There is no universal "frequency 3" rule.

| Objective | Frequency ceiling (7-day) | Read | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prospecting / cold** (Awareness, top-funnel) | ~1.5–2.5 | Cold audiences fatigue fast; CTR decay past this band usually reads as creative fatigue while reach is still growing | Estimated |
| **Warm retargeting** (site visitors, cart, engagers) | ~4–7 | A warm, invested pool tolerates more exposures before CTR/CVR fall; a plateau in reach *with* a rising frequency reads as saturation, not fatigue | Estimated |
| **Retention / existing customers** (short-window winback) | ~6–10 | The most tolerant band, but the pool is smallest, so saturation arrives on a shorter calendar even if the per-user ceiling is high | Estimated |

Notes on reading the band:
- **Prospecting < warm < retention** is the ordering that holds; the exact numbers are platform- and vertical-dependent, so treat them as Estimated and state the ceiling you used.
- A number inside the band with **falling CTR** still signals fatigue — the ceiling is a prompt to check the slope, not a pass.
- A number above the band with **flat CTR/CVR** is not yet a problem; do not rotate on the frequency figure alone.
- Longer windows (28-day) inflate frequency mechanically; do not compare a 28-day frequency against a 7-day band.

| `scripts/connectors/gsc.py` | *proposed* | 4 | Google Search Console impressions/position/clicks |

## Relationship to the Eight Frameworks

CORE-EEAT, CITE, C3, ROAS, SEND, RAMP, ECHO, and TALE scores are advisory quality-control summaries. Deterministic math guards internal consistency; it does not establish reliability or external validity. Outcome calibration must follow the preregistered, version-locked study in [`scoring-semantics.md`](scoring-semantics.md). Until that study succeeds for a named profile/population/outcome, present scores as structured audit evidence, not outcome predictors.
