# *stdlib-only* connector/check helpers. No pip / third-party deps, ever. This
# guard fails CLOSED: every top-level module imported by scripts/*.py and
# scripts/connectors/*.py must be on the ALLOWLIST — (a) the Python standard
# library (sys.stdlib_module_names, queried from the interpreter at runtime) or
# (b) a local module in those same directories (derived from the .py filenames,
# e.g. _http, robots). Anything else — numpy, requests, yaml, or a brand-new
# package no denylist has heard of — fails the build, naming file and module.
#
# Run: bash scripts/check-stdlib-only.sh   (exit 0 = clean, 1 = violation)
