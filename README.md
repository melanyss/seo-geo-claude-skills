[English](README.md) | [中文](docs/README.zh.md)

A library of Claude Skills and slash commands that turns a chat agent into a marketing operator. Four disciplines and a shared protocol layer, at a glance:

| Layer | Skills | Lifecycle (phase directories) | Framework → gate | Entrypoint |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| **SEO/GEO** | 16 | research → build → optimize → monitor | [CORE-EEAT](references/core-eeat-benchmark.md) → `content-quality-auditor` · [CITE](references/cite-domain-rating.md) → `domain-authority-auditor` | `/aaron-marketing:seo-geo` |
| **Influencer (IMPACT)** | 16 | discover → plan → activate → measure | [C³](references/c3-benchmark.md) → `content-reviewer` (ART); `fit-scorer` scores ACE | `/aaron-marketing:impact` |
| **Paid ads (ROAS)** | 16 | research → orchestrate → activate → scale | [ROAS](references/roas-benchmark.md) → `ad-account-auditor` (RQS) | `/aaron-marketing:ad` |
| **Email (SEND)** | 16 | setup → engage → nurture → deliver | [SEND](references/send-benchmark.md) → `email-quality-auditor` (EQS) | `/aaron-marketing:email` |
| **Protocol layer** | 5 | — (shared machinery, outside the phase flows) | 4 truth registries (entity · creator · offer/claims · consent) + HOT/WARM/COLD memory | — |

`/aaron-marketing:auto` routes any natural-language goal across all of it. Everything is **plain Markdown** — the only code is a Bash hook runner, a Bash validator, and zero-dependency Python-stdlib data helpers (no `pip`, no build step). **Every skill runs at Tier 1 with nothing but data you paste in**; connectors only automate retrieval.

> The SEO/GEO half also ships on its own, unchanged, at [seo-geo-claude-skills](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills) for users who only want SEO/GEO work.

## Why this library

| Principle | What it means in practice |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Keyless by default** | Every skill works at **Tier 1** with data you paste or pull from free/first-party sources. Paid tools and MCP servers are an opt-in convenience, never a precondition. Paid-ads skills score from your **own-account manual export** — keyed ad APIs are never required. |
| **Markdown, not a framework** | Skills are content. The only executable code is `hooks/claude-hook.sh` (Bash), `scripts/validate-skill.sh` (Bash), and `scripts/connectors/*.py` (Python **standard library only**). Nothing to install, audit, or keep up to date. |
| **One shared contract** | All 69 skills expose the same seven sections and self-declare `discipline` + `phase` metadata, so the library behaves like one operating system: each skill knows its inputs, outputs, and the next best skill to hand off to. |
| **Gated quality** | Five benchmarks drive five auditor-class gates that emit structured, machine-checkable verdicts — not vibes. A PostToolUse hook validates every gated artifact before it lands. |
| **Truth lives in registries** | Canonical facts (brand entities, creator dossiers, offer/claim substantiation, per-subject consent) live in dedicated protocol-layer registries with sole-writer rules — gates judge against them instead of re-deriving them. |
| **Memory across turns** | A HOT/WARM/COLD memory model carries findings, scores, and open loops between skills and sessions, sanitized on the way in. |
| **Plain voice** | Skills ship an AI-slop detector and a banned-phrase list so output reads like a human wrote it. |

---

## Install

Use it with Claude Code, any Agent Skills-compatible host, or a plain `git clone`:

| Host | Install |
|------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` then `/plugin install aaron-marketing@aaron` |
| **Codex · Cursor · OpenCode · Antigravity · Gemini CLI · Copilot CLI · OpenClaw · Hermes · [70+ hosts](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents)** | `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` |
| **[SkillHub.cn](https://skillhub.cn) (中文社区)** | `skillhub install aaron-<skill-name>` (e.g. `aaron-keyword-research`) |
| **Any host** | `git clone https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills` |

In Claude Code, `marketplace add` only registers the catalog — run `/plugin install aaron-marketing@aaron` (or pick it from `/plugin`) to actually enable the skills and commands. To pull a **single** skill on a generic host: `npx skills add aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills -s keyword-research`. Browse the bundle on the [skills.sh registry](https://skills.sh/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills). Per-agent directories, frontmatter quirks, and what degrades outside the plugin: [docs/agent-compatibility.md](docs/agent-compatibility.md) (verified 69/69 installable, 2026-07).

Installing the plugin adds **nothing** to your `/mcp` list — the MCP catalogue lives in [`docs/mcp-catalog.json`](docs/mcp-catalog.json), deliberately outside the plugin-root `.mcp.json` path that Claude Code auto-registers, so it is a copy-paste reference only (see [Connectors](#connectors--enhancement-tiers)).

---

## First run

If your host supports automatic skill routing, just describe the goal:

```text
Research keywords for my SaaS product targeting small teams
```
```text
Find TikTok creators for a skincare launch and score their fit
```
```text
Audit this Google Ads account before I scale — exports attached
```

Or use the slash commands — `/auto` for routing, or a discipline entrypoint:

```text
/aaron-marketing:auto turn our pricing page into an AI-citable comparison hub
```
```text
/aaron-marketing:seo-geo https://example.com/blog/my-article --mode audit
```

`/aaron-marketing:auto` infers intent and runs the smallest useful workflow, stopping only at blocking decisions. Every skill works with pasted data; optional tools are documented in [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

---

## Architecture

### The shared skill contract

Every skill follows the **same activation contract** — seven sections in a fixed order:

1. **Trigger / when-to-use** — when the skill should fire.
2. **Quick Start** — copy-paste prompts.
3. **Skill Contract** — Expected output · Reads · Writes · Promotes · Done-when · Primary next skill.
4. **Handoff Summary** — the standard hand-off shape so the next skill picks up cleanly.
5. **Data Sources** — `~~category` placeholders, each with a keyless Tier-1 path.
6. **Instructions** — the numbered method (treats all exports as untrusted input).
7. **Next Best Skill** — where to go next (with visited-set + max-depth termination rules).

Every skill also self-declares `metadata.discipline` (seo-geo / influencer / paid / protocol) and `metadata.phase`, so routing and clustering work uniformly. The contract is documented once in [skill-contract.md](references/skill-contract.md); the shared cross-skill state lives in [state-model.md](references/state-model.md).

### One lifecycle, four dialects

The four disciplines share one meta-lifecycle spine; each adapts the granularity to its own workflow (phase *counts* differ by design):

| Meta-stage | SEO/GEO | Influencer (IMPACT) | Paid (ROAS) | Email (SEND) |
|------------|---------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Understand** | research | discover | research | setup |
| **Plan / create** | build | plan | orchestrate | engage |
| **Activate / optimize** | optimize | activate | activate | nurture |
| **Measure** | monitor | measure | scale | deliver |

All four use phase **directories** (`seo-geo/research/`…, `influencer/discover/`…, `ad/research/`…, `email/setup/`…). Note "activate" means creator outreach in IMPACT but account-gating in ROAS — same word, discipline-specific scope.

### Quality system: five frameworks, five gates

Five benchmarks make "good" measurable. Each defines dimensions, a rollup method, and a small set of **veto items** (hard fails that cap or block a score regardless of the rest):

| Framework | Scores | Items / dimensions | Rollup | Veto items |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|--------|------------|
| **[CORE-EEAT](references/core-eeat-benchmark.md)** | Content quality (GEO = CORE avg, SEO = EEAT avg) | 80 items / 8 dimensions | per-dimension averages | `T04`, `C01`, `R10` |
| **[CITE](references/cite-domain-rating.md)** | Domain authority & citation trust | 40 items / 4 dimensions | arithmetic weighted mean | `T03`, `T05`, `T09` |
| **[C³](references/c3-benchmark.md)** | Influencer Creator / Content / Campaign | ACE / ART / ROI · 9 dimensions | **CVI = (ACE × ART × ROI)^⅓** (geometric) | ACE `A2`/`C1`/`E2`, ART `T1`/`T2` |
| **[ROAS](references/roas-benchmark.md)** | Paid ads Return / Offer / Audience / Spend-efficiency | R / O / A / S | **RQS = floor(goal-weighted mean)** (arithmetic) | `R1`/`R2`/`O1`/`O2`/`A1` |
| **[SEND](references/send-benchmark.md)** | Email marketing Sender-integrity / Engagement / Nurture / Direct-response | S / E / N / D | **EQS = floor(goal-weighted mean)** (arithmetic) | `S1`/`S2`/`N1`/`D1` |

Each framework is enforced by an **auditor-class gate** — a skill that writes a gated artifact (`class: auditor-output`) validated by the PostToolUse hook. Gates are workflow steps, so each lives in its discipline and is counted there:

| Gate | Framework | Lives in | Verdict |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| [content-quality-auditor](seo-geo/optimize/content-quality-auditor/SKILL.md) | CORE-EEAT | `seo-geo/optimize/` (SEO/GEO) | SHIP / FIX / BLOCK before publishing |
| [domain-authority-auditor](seo-geo/monitor/domain-authority-auditor/SKILL.md) | CITE | `seo-geo/monitor/` (SEO/GEO) | TRUSTED / CAUTIOUS / UNTRUSTED |
| [content-reviewer](influencer/activate/content-reviewer/SKILL.md) | C³ ART | `influencer/activate/` (influencer) | APPROVED / REVISIONS / REJECTED before a creator post ships |
| [ad-account-auditor](ad/activate/ad-account-auditor/SKILL.md) | ROAS RQS | `ad/activate/` (paid) | SHIP / FIX / BLOCK before budgets scale |
| [email-quality-auditor](email/deliver/email-quality-auditor/SKILL.md) | SEND EQS | `email/deliver/` (email) | SHIP / FIX / BLOCK before send |

**Shared cap chassis:** a single veto caps the affected dimension and the overall at `min(raw, 60)`; **two or more vetoes → `BLOCKED`** (no final score). Verdicts are translated to plain language (no item IDs in user-facing reports). Gate mechanics — handoff schema, cap arithmetic, artifact-gate checklist — are specified once in [auditor-runbook.md](references/auditor-runbook.md), and the arithmetic of all five frameworks is locked by a deterministic golden test (see [Quality guards](#quality-guards-ci)).

### The protocol layer

The `protocol/` directory holds the **shared truth & memory machinery** that sits outside the discipline phase-flows — 5 skills, counted separately:

| Skill | Job | Anchored to | Canonical store |
|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| [entity-optimizer](protocol/entity-optimizer/SKILL.md) | Canonical brand/entity profile (Knowledge Graph, Wikidata, AI disambiguation) | SEO/GEO | `memory/entities/` |
| [creator-registry](protocol/creator-registry/SKILL.md) | Canonical creator roster/dossier — deduped handles, provenance-labeled audience stats, rates, compliance history | influencer | `memory/creators/` |
| [offer-claims-registry](protocol/offer-claims-registry/SKILL.md) | Offer & claim-substantiation ledger — the record the O1/T2 claim checks are judged against | paid | `memory/claims/` |
| [consent-registry](protocol/consent-registry/SKILL.md) | Canonical per-subject consent/suppression record — the S2/N1 vetoes judge against it | email | `memory/consent/` |
| [memory-management](protocol/memory-management/SKILL.md) | HOT/WARM/COLD memory lifecycle (capture · promote · demote · archive · query) | all disciplines | `memory/` |

The registries follow a **sole-writer rule** (other skills submit via `candidates.md`), and they *curate* — the gates *judge*. The genuinely horizontal layer beneath everything is the `references/` protocols ([auditor-runbook](references/auditor-runbook.md), [state-model](references/state-model.md), [skill-contract](references/skill-contract.md), [humanizer-slop](references/humanizer-slop.md), [measurement-protocol](references/measurement-protocol.md)) — shared by design as documents, not skills.

### Memory & automation hooks

**Memory** is temperature-tiered, so context survives across skills and sessions without bloating the prompt:

| Tier | Location | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| **HOT** | `memory/hot-cache.md` | Auto-loaded each session; capped at **80 lines AND 25 KB** (whichever trips first). |
| **WARM** | `memory/<subdir>/` | Per-skill working state, gated audit artifacts (`memory/audits/`), and the registries' canonical stores (`memory/entities\|creators\|claims/`). |
| **COLD** | `memory/archive/` | Demoted/older records, kept for recall. |

**Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`, runner `hooks/claude-hook.sh`) wire four Claude Code events:

| Event | Matcher | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `SessionStart` | `startup\|resume\|clear\|compact` | Injects the **sanitized** hot-cache + an open-loops pointer (prompt-injection lines are redacted; symlinked caches are rejected). |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | (all) | Lightweight per-prompt context hook. |
| `PostToolUse` | `Write\|Edit` | Hot-cache size warning **+ the Artifact Gate**: any file under `memory/audits/` that declares `class: auditor-output` is validated against the handoff schema and cap fields, or the write is blocked. The five auditor-class gates must declare that marker by contract; unmarked files are not auditor artifacts and pass through. |
| `Stop` | (all) | No-op (exits silently). |

The Artifact Gate is **framework-agnostic** — the same hook validates CORE-EEAT, CITE, C³, ROAS, and SEND artifacts with no per-framework code.

| placement-exclusion-manager | A | *(NEW)* Placement/audience exclusion lists — brand-safety blocks, junk-placement pruning, wasted-spend suppression. |
| conversion-value-mapper | R | *(NEW)* Map conversion actions to values/weights and value rules so tROAS bids on true margin, not raw counts. |
| paid-measurement-loop | R (+S) | Read one shipped change back against a control over a window → Promote / Keep-testing / Rollback / Unproven. |
| attribution-reconciler | R | Standing order-ID de-dup against the GA4/ecommerce truth set, window/currency normalization, model comparison, incrementality. |

</details>

### Email — SEND (16)

Four phase directories under `email/` (4 skills each) follow the SEND loop; the gate (⛩ email-quality-auditor) sits in Deliver. Only the gate computes the goal-weighted EQS — every other skill works one lever and hands off. Use-case-agnostic (B2C lifecycle / B2B cold outbound / newsletter-creator); the goal-weight column picks the emphasis.

## Commands

Five commands: `/aaron-marketing:auto` routes any goal across all four disciplines, and each discipline has exactly one explicit entrypoint. Source: [commands/](commands).

| Command | Use it for | Narrowing |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `/aaron-marketing:auto` | Describe any goal — infers intent and runs the smallest useful workflow | `--deep` (exhaustive / stress-test) |
| `/aaron-marketing:seo-geo` | SEO/GEO end-to-end: research demand/competitors, create content, audit quality/tech/visibility/authority, track rankings/reports/memory | `--mode research\|create\|audit\|track` + per-mode flags (`--competitors` `--map` · `--brief` `--series` `--refresh` `--publish` `--meta` `--schema` `--type` · `--full` `--tech` `--visibility` `--authority` · `--alert` `--report` `--remember` `--period`) |
| `/aaron-marketing:impact` | Influencer (IMPACT): audience insight, discovery & fit, planning, outreach, amplification, ROI | `--phase discover\|plan\|activate\|measure` |
| `/aaron-marketing:ad` | Paid ads (ROAS loop): segments, structure, creative, experiment design, the audit gate, measurement | `--phase research\|orchestrate\|activate\|scale` |
| `/aaron-marketing:email` | Email (SEND loop): deliverability/consent, segmentation, creative, lifecycle flows, monetization, send-testing, the audit gate | `--phase setup\|engage\|nurture\|deliver` |

Daily work normally starts with `/aaron-marketing:auto`; the other four are explicit discipline entrypoints, with `--mode` / `--phase` to narrow the stage.

**Rename note:** commands use the `/aaron-marketing:` prefix. The former `research` / `create` / `audit` / `track` commands are now modes of `/aaron-marketing:seo-geo` (flags unchanged). Older `/seo:*` and `/aaron-seo-geo:*` names recover via `auto` — e.g. `/aaron-marketing:auto /aaron-seo-geo:audit https://example.com/blog/post` returns `/aaron-marketing:seo-geo https://example.com/blog/post --mode audit`.

## Connectors & enhancement tiers

Skills name tools with `~~category` placeholders (`~~SEO tool`, `~~web analytics`, `~~ad platform`, `~~email platform`, …) instead of specific vendors, and every category has a **keyless Tier-1 path**. Full recipes — including the free/first-party endpoint for each category — are in [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).

### The connector layer is a product in itself

**100+ documented integration paths** across three engineered layers — and every one of them earns its place:

| Layer | What you get |
|-------|--------------|
| **21 bundled zero-dependency connectors** | Pure Python stdlib — no `pip`, no build step. Keyless live SERP + JS-rendered scraping (Firecrawl, Tavily), an AI-answer citation probe, DNS-over-HTTPS email-auth pulls, Wikipedia attention series, GDELT news mentions, real YouTube creator metrics, IndexNow + Baidu index push, Resend ESP automation, and a git-diffable measurement ledger that turns any of them into a before/after time series. |
| **60+ documented official/free APIs** | Every row links the vendor's **official documentation**, carries a verified-on date, and every link is HTTP-checked before it ships. Includes the paths most tool lists miss: GSC URL Inspection, CrUX History (40 weeks of field CWV), the Gmail Postmaster Tools API, Meta's Ad Library, Microsoft Clarity's Data Export API. |
| **Vendor MCP servers** | 18 remote endpoints catalogued (never auto-registered — your `/mcp` list stays clean) plus the official self-hosted servers for Google Analytics, Search Console, **Google Ads**, and **Microsoft Clarity**. Two remote MCPs work with no key at all (Firecrawl, Tavily). |

What makes them trustworthy rather than just numerous:

- **Three safety classes, engineered gates** ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)): hosted fetchers run a **local robots.txt pre-flight** before every delegated fetch and refuse on Disallow; anything that mutates external state (email sends, index pushes) is **dry-run by default** behind an explicit `--live` flag, with idempotency keys where the vendor supports them and no auto-retry where it doesn't.
- **Verified, then re-verified**: endpoints are checked against primary vendor docs with dates, keyless paths are live-tested, a CI guard enforces version/tracking sync, and a pre-release live smoke catches endpoint drift (it has already caught real API changes — twice).
- **Facts, not verdicts**: connectors report record presence, parsed tags, and raw series; the auditor gates do the judging, and skills label every number **Measured / User-provided / Estimated**.
- **A written playbook** ([docs/connector-playbook.md](docs/connector-playbook.md)) governs every addition — qualify, verify, implement, test, wire, document, track, regress, record — so quality holds as the catalog grows.

| Tier | Requires | You get |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Tier 1** (default) | Nothing | Paste data, or pull it from free/public sources. The full analysis framework runs either way. |
| **Tier 2** | One free first-party API or MCP | Automatic retrieval of your own GSC / GA4 / Core Web Vitals data. |
| **Tier 3** | A fuller MCP set | Fully automated multi-source workflows. |

- **Bundled zero-dependency helpers** under `scripts/connectors/` (Python stdlib only) pull public/own data locally — e.g. PageSpeed/CrUX, Open PageRank, page crawl, Wayback CDX, Wikidata SPARQL, Common Crawl, advertools recipes — plus **`resend.py`**, direct Resend ESP automation for the email skills (free-tier key: domain-auth status, seed-test sends, suppression sync, broadcast scheduling; mutating subcommands dry-run by default and require `--live`), and **`firecrawl.py`** + **`tavily.py`**, keyless hosted-fetcher automation for the research skills (Firecrawl: live web SERP + JS-rendered page markdown + site maps; Tavily: scored search + an AI answer engine's cited-sources probe for GEO + URL extract — both free with no key at all, both with a local robots.txt pre-flight built in).
- **Free/keyless sources** documented per category: Google Search Console & GA4 (own data), PageSpeed/CrUX, Wikidata, Common Crawl, Open PageRank, Firecrawl keyless SERP/scrape, Tavily keyless AI-search, DNS-over-HTTPS email-auth records (`doh.py`), Wikipedia attention series (`pageviews.py`), GDELT news mentions (`gdelt.py`), YouTube creator metrics on a free key (`youtube.py`), IndexNow + Baidu index push (`indexpush.py`, dry-run gated), the ad-transparency libraries (Meta/Google/TikTok), and recipe rows for crt.sh, the W3C validator, oEmbed, and HN Algolia.
- **Opt-in MCP servers** (Ahrefs, Semrush, SE Ranking, SISTRIX, SimilarWeb, the self-hosted free **OpenSEO** suite, Cloudflare, Vercel, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Webflow, Sanity, Contentful, Slack, Resend, the keyless Firecrawl and Tavily) are catalogued in [`docs/mcp-catalog.json`](docs/mcp-catalog.json) as a **copy-paste reference only** — the catalog sits outside the auto-registered plugin-root `.mcp.json` path, so nothing is registered for you. Copy the entries you want into your own MCP config.

Paid-ads skills score from your **own-account manual export** (native ad-manager CSV, GA4, ecommerce). Keyed ad-platform APIs (Google Ads SDK, Meta Marketing API) are opt-in Tier-2/3 only and **never** a Tier-1 requirement. Email skills score the same way — from your **own ESP export** — and every deliverability signal is keyless (DNS lookups, a DMARC RUA report, and a seed-list inbox test), so a keyed ESP API is never a Tier-1 requirement either; when Resend is your ESP, the bundled `resend.py` automates the same loop on the free tier.

## Recommended workflows

**SEO/GEO**
1. **Research** — `keyword-research` → `competitor-analysis` → `content-gap-analysis`
2. **Build** — `content-writer` → `geo-content-optimizer` → `serp-markup-builder` / `page-play-builder`
3. **Optimize** — `content-quality-auditor` (⛩ publish gate) → `on-page-seo-auditor` → `technical-seo-checker` → `site-structure-optimizer`
4. **Monitor** — `rank-tracker` → `performance-monitor` → `offsite-signal-analyzer`; `domain-authority-auditor` (⛩) for the trust review

**Influencer (IMPACT)**
1. **Discover** — `audience-mapper` → `trend-spotter` → `influencer-discovery` → `fit-scorer` (C³ ACE)
2. **Plan** — `competitor-tracker` → `campaign-planner` → `brief-generator` → `budget-optimizer`
3. **Activate** — `outreach-manager` → `content-reviewer` (⛩ ART gate) → `contract-helper` → `content-amplifier`
4. **Measure** — `landing-optimizer` → `performance-analyzer` → `roi-calculator` → `report-generator`

**Paid Ads (ROAS loop)**
1. **Research** — `audience-segment-builder` → `campaign-architect`
2. **Orchestrate** — `ad-creative-builder` → `ad-test-designer` (+ `landing-optimizer` for the page)
3. **Activate** — `conversion-signal-qa` → `ad-account-auditor` (⛩ RQS gate) before any budget goes live
4. **Scale** — `paid-measurement-loop` → `attribution-reconciler` → `roi-calculator` → `report-generator`

**Email (SEND loop)**
1. **Setup** — `deliverability-qa` → `list-segment-builder`
2. **Engage** — `email-creative-builder`
3. **Nurture** — `email-sequence-designer` → `newsletter-monetization-planner`
4. **Deliver** — `send-experiment-designer` → `email-quality-auditor` (⛩ EQS gate) before send

For a full trust review, pair `content-quality-auditor` with `domain-authority-auditor` for a combined 120-item assessment. With `memory-management` active, handoffs and open loops persist in HOT/WARM/COLD memory automatically.

## Design philosophy

- **Skills are content.** The only code is the Bash validator, the Bash hook runner, and zero-dependency Python-stdlib connector/check helpers. No third-party / `pip` dependencies, ever — enforced by a dependency-creep guard.
- **Keyless first.** Every `~~category` has a free/own-data recipe; MCP and paid tools are pure convenience.
- **Surgical & MECE.** Each skill owns one job with a crisp scope boundary; overlapping work ships as a *mode* of an existing skill rather than a new thin skill. Registries curate, gates judge, analyzers feed gates.
- **No invented numbers.** Skills label every figure Measured / User-provided / Estimated and ship an AI-slop / banned-phrase detector.
- **Compliance is guidance, not law.** FTC-disclosure and claim-integrity checks flag risk; they are not legal advice.

---

## Quality guards (CI)

Every change runs against a set of fail-closed guards (all in `scripts/` and `tests/`):

| Guard | Checks |
|-------|--------|
| `validate-skill.sh` | Frontmatter, required sections, version consistency, plugin-relative links across all 69 skills. |
| `golden-auditor-math.py` | Deterministic weight-sum + worked-example arithmetic for **all five** frameworks. |
| `check-evals.py` | Eval structural lint + `structure-manifest.json` (69/69 skills carry eval cases). |
| `check-pii.py` | Blocks committed secrets / PII (token-level allowlist, fail-closed). |
| `check-stdlib-only.sh` | Dependency-creep guard + the Paid-Ads keyed-API red line. |
| `check-versions.sh` | Version-sync guard: bundle version identical across plugin.json / both marketplace mirrors / both README badges / CLAUDE.md / VERSIONS.md release line + changelog entry, and every SKILL.md version matches its VERSIONS.md row. |
| `tests/test_connectors_local.py` | Offline unit tests for every connector's pure request-builders (no network in CI). |
| `tests/test_hook_artifact_gate.sh` | Behavior tests for the hook's Artifact Gate + SessionStart sanitization. |

Live endpoint drift is covered separately by the **manual** [`scripts/connectors/smoke-live.sh`](scripts/connectors/smoke-live.sh) — one minimal real call per hosted connector with shape assertions (rate-limit answers count as SKIP); run it before a release, never in CI.
