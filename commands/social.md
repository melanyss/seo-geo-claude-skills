# Social Command

Run the organic-social lifecycle along the **ECHO loop** (Explore → Craft → Host → Observe). Skills operate from the user's **own data, project memory, and keyless public surfaces** — keyed social suites and scheduler platforms are never required, and this discipline ships **no posting/engagement automation of any kind**. The auditor selects either `asset-gate` or one program-maturity profile; asset and operating constructs are never combined.

## Route

Infer the ECHO-loop phase from the goal (or honor `--phase`) and route to the matching skill:

- **Explore** — channel-portfolio-planner (capability/access matrix + channel selection; access classes per `references/social-platform-access.md`), voice-dossier-builder (brand + founder voice from own posts, content pillars), platform-norm-profiler (dated norm cards under `references/platforms/`), participation-warmup-planner (pre-promotion ramp + warming→active graduation criteria; owned-community variant); record decided channels/states via channel-registry (`memory/channels/`)
- **Craft** — social-calendar-builder (always-on calendar; publish step hard-requires the gate's pre-publish SHIP), social-creative-builder (one idea → N platform-native packages incl. 小红书/carousel modes; unresolved claims become claims proposals), short-video-scripter (retention-gate beat sheets incl. 抖音/视频号 params, AI-disclosure default), advocacy-program-designer (opt-in advocacy/founder programs, anti-pod guardrails)
- **Host** — social-quality-auditor (asset gate or separate program-maturity profile; channel/claim/rights evidence from projections), engagement-inbox-manager (DRAFT replies/rights evidence only), social-selling-planner (human operating block), crisis-response-planner (human-executed pause protocol)
- **Observe** — social-pulse-monitor (always-on listening via `bluesky.py`/`fediverse.py`/`discourse.py`/`hn.py`/`gdelt.py`/`tavily.py`; X/IG/TikTok/LinkedIn are proxy-only, labeled), share-of-voice-tracker (locked competitor panel), dark-social-attributor (UTM/share hygiene + self-reported field + GA4 direct decomposition, all Estimated-labeled), social-measurement-loop (denominator-locked metric dictionary, community-health mode, write-back); reuse roi-calculator / report-generator / performance-analyzer

## Rules

- `social-quality-auditor` runs `asset-gate` for a publish package or one separate program-maturity profile. The asset gate verifies relevant E1/C1/C2/H1/H2/O1 controls; publishing/unpausing remains a separate explicit action.
- `memory/events/channels.ndjson` is channel truth history. Other skills submit idempotent `operation: propose` events; `channel-registry` resolves them and owns canonical transitions. Dossiers and standing files are generated views. A missing dossier remains Unknown/NEEDS_INPUT, never pass-by-default.
- Keyless Tier 1 — read from own analytics exports plus the keyless connectors; closed platforms (X/IG/TikTok/LinkedIn/小红书) enter as user exports (Measured, as-of) or proxy reads that are always labeled proxy, never Measured. Platform folklore (posting hours, hashtag counts) is Estimated context with named sources, never a scored rule.
- Asset and program profiles are never averaged. Outcomes remain measured metrics; over-posting/capacity is a program finding, not an automatic veto.
- No manufactured or baited engagement, no pods, no bought followers, no automated replies/DMs, no mass connection requests — veto-class (ECHO H1). UGC republishing requires a recorded permission (`ugc-permissions.md`); public posting is never permission, organic consent never covers paid use (ECHO H2). Disclose material connections and realistic synthetic media (ECHO C2).
- **Scope edge — the three-way "post this" split**: the always-on brand posting calendar and net-new packages are this discipline (social-calendar-builder / social-creative-builder); "boost this post" / repurposing an existing asset is [content-amplifier](../influencer/activate/content-amplifier/SKILL.md) with paid execution in the ROAS discipline; launch-day community submissions (PH/HN/directories) are [community-launch-runner](../launch/mobilize/community-launch-runner/SKILL.md). Creator collabs start at [campaign-planner](../influencer/plan/campaign-planner/SKILL.md); creator deliverable gating stays with [content-reviewer](../influencer/activate/content-reviewer/SKILL.md); 1:1 pitch mechanics run on [outreach-manager](../influencer/activate/outreach-manager/SKILL.md); email lanes stay with the SEND discipline.

## Output

Return inline artifacts by default. Files may be written only when the user explicitly asks and the runtime can write.
