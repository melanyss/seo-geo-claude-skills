#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_hook_artifact_gate.sh — behavior tests for hooks/claude-hook.sh
# Covers the PostToolUse Artifact Gate (auditor-output validation) and the
# SessionStart sanitization / symlink-rejection safety paths.
#
# Run: bash tests/test_hook_artifact_gate.sh   (exits non-zero on any failure)
#
# Why this exists: claude-hook.sh is the repo's only runtime-logic file and its
# gate is awk-heavy; a regression (e.g. the hb() blank-line truncation bug) is
# invisible to `bash -n`. These cases assert real block/pass decisions.
#
# Note: field() is intentionally left unchanged — the documented format always gives
# cap fields a same-line inline value, which the good.md / blocked_ok.md fixtures
# below exercise (cap_applied: false on its own line, value present).
